# CLI DnD

This is pretty self explanatory. I'm learning java so I figured no better way to learn some concepts than to make a linear DnD adventure. It's definitely not good, nor is it polished, or optimized, but it works as a proof of concept. Don't crucify me. If you have any recommendations or feedback they are greatly appreciated.

## To-Do

From here in no particular order my priorities are as follows:

-[ ] Variable enemy damage 
-[ ] Create just item shop
-[ ] (Maybe) Add spells
-[ ] Stat rolls
-[ ] Making an actually good game
-[ ] Tavern functionality (I lied this is actually first up because it'll mean I finish all basic functionality I need to start expanding cities (if I do that))
-[ ] Town traversal maybe ???
