# CLI DnD

This is pretty self explanatory. I'm learning java so I figured no better way to learn some concepts than to make a linear DnD adventure. It's definitely not good, nor is it polished, or optimized, but it works as a proof of concept. Don't crucify me. If you have any recommendations or feedback they are greatly appreciated.

My friend is also making their own! (mine is better trust). Check it out! It's different from mine but I helped them (because they suck), anyway check it out :) [Worse One](https://github.com/howmanyusersaretakn/DND)

## To-Do

From here in no particular order my priorities are as follows:

- [ ] Create just item shop
- [ ] (Maybe) Add spells
- [ ] Making an actually good game ***(Optional)***
- [ ] Tavern functionality ***(In progress)***

Here's everything I HAVE managed to tick off the list so far:

- [x] Variable enemy damage
- [x] Stat rolls
